<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamcalinprojects/Input-devChallenges/main/Inputs.png)

This project shows a list of inputs styles than you can select according to your needs.
It was build in react, using bootstrap and props in order to get different types of inputs.

I have learned a little more about props and validation.
For the icon I have used the library React-Icons, you can find more about by checking the documentation at this link: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/.
